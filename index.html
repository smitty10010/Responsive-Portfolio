                    Hello, my name is Robert and I'm looking to learn new things and to transition into a new career. I'm originally from California and I've worked for 15 years as a data analyst in the national security sector. It has been a fun and exciting career, but
                    it is time to try something new. I'm interested in technology and learning web development. As a government employee you don't have a lot of room to create new things, however by transitioning into a field like web development I can
                    finally create interesting things and work with creative people. This is an exciting time for me, and I'm looking forward to building new releationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When not working, I enjoy spending time with my family. Some of my hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, and reading the news.
                </p>
